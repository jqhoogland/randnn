    "# Applying the transfer operator approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Measurement / Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by simulating the data, a $N$-dimensional time series of $T$ timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T \\times N$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Initial dimensional reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the random neural network, we know that the chaotic dynamics exist near a much lower-dimensional manifold. Therefore, we don't need to deal with a very high-dimensional space (and thus computationally intractable), but can play with a much lower dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using PCA we project down to a dimensionality $D$. We can choose this ourselves, or choose it automatically via some measure of manifold dimensionality. For example, the Lyapunov-spectrum-derived attractor dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this choice of $D$ may not be optimal (Engelken et al. 2020 found that the \"PCA dimension\" could vary independently from the attractor dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "$T \\times D$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Downsampling \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the long-term behavior of the system (and have finitely powerful computers), so we downsample the trajectory with a downsampling rate $D$ (i.e. keeping one in $D$ timesteps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the optimal number of delays, we choose the number of delays for which the KS entropy stops decresaing.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T/R \\times D$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. (Optional) Delay embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the Markovianity of our state, we may stack delayed copies of measurements within a short time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T/R - K + 1 \\times KD$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Second dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From the delay-embedded space, we can project down to a more manageable $M$ dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T/R - K + 1 \\times M$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "From any time-series $t \\times d$, we can readily compute a transfer matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we cluster the time series into $C$ clusters (using, e.g. K-means clustering). This turns our time series into a $t$ dimensional vector, where each entry is the index of that timestep's assigned cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create a transfer matrix from this series, for a given choice of the transition time scale, $\\tau$. \n",
    "We create a $C\\times C$ dimensional matrix whose $ij$-th component is the likelihood of moving from cluster $i$ to cluster $j$ in $\\tau$ timesteps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the downsampling rate and transfer matrix transition time scale have roughly the same function. It is, however, computationally easier to downsample as much as possible first.\n",
